## Edward Martin

#### Inspiration
What gets me up in the morning? Or more approriately, what keeps me up until early hours of the morning? Building a product which is useful to somebody, and positively contributes to the world. 

#### Ed, Edd, Eddy?
Ed will do the job (very well, *hint*), or if you're my Mum, Edward. I'm an aspiring Full-Stack Developer with a commercial upbringing. My school years were predominantly Business Studies focused, complemented by a 2:1 Business Management degree at Carfiff University, so it's no surprise to hear that my working career to date has been Comercially focused.
