### <a name="Ambition">Ambition</a>
I've never been afraid to put in the work, my brain is a sponge for new information, and I am already well on my way towards my ultimate goal of becoming a Full-Stack Software Engineer. My code will be readable, secure, test driven, performant and succinct. I am determined to never stop learning, to never stop asking questions, and to continuously better myself - one problem solved at a time.

What gets me up in the morning? Or more appropriately, what keeps me up until early hours of the morning? Building a product which is useful to somebody, and positively contributes to the world.

### <a name="About">About me</a>
Is it Ed or Edward...? Ed will do the job (*very well*). I'm an aspiring Full-Stack Developer with a commercial upbringing. My school years were predominantly Business Studies focused, complemented by a 2:1 Business Management degree at Cardiff University, so it's no surprise to hear that my working career to date has been comercially focused. 

It didn't take long, in my first few months of employment I was building Excel Macros projects to improve my teams efficiency and, from that point on, constantly searching for my next project while asyncronously teaching myself the basics of VBA. 

Gone are the days of my confinement to spreadsheet code, I've lept head-first into my new career with the help of the 12 week intensive coding program at Makers Academy. I've been unleashed into the programming world and I'm excited to put on display my journey so far, and demonstrate my ever increasing tech stack through my portfolio of projects ([Ed's Repositories](https://github.com/EMDevelop?tab=repositories)).
