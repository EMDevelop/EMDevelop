#### Business Development Manager (Growth Team) | MVF Global (April 2019 – September 2021)

Responsible for Researching, Selling, Launching and Account Managing new industry launches.

I taught myself SQL to an advanced level, automated labour-intensive manual reports, and created guides for new starters in the company to understand what was a complex insurance software product.

#### Assistant Procurement Manager | Laing O’Rourke (Sept 2015 – August 2017)

Responsible for managing purchase contracts between a national building contractor and its suppliers. It was here that I created a full P2P system in just Microsoft Excel (VBA), which is still used in the company to this day.
