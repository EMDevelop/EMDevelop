### <a name="Inspiration">Inspiration</a>

I have always embraced hard work. My brain is a sponge for new information and I am determined to continue learning, to be constantly curious, and to never stop asking questions. My code will be readable, secure, test driven, and succinct.
It gets me up in the morning and sustains me into the early hours, I am passionate about building solutions with utility, and a positive impact in the world.

### <a name="About">About me</a>

I'm a Full-Stack Developer with 5 years commercial experience. My education was predominantly Business Studies focused, culminating in a 2:1 Business Management degree from Cardiff University, so it's no surprise to understand that my working career to date has been commercially focused.

It didn't take long for me to start developing solutions. In my first few months of employment I was building Excel VBA Macros to improve team efficiency, while constantly searching for my next project.

Gone are the days of my confinement to spreadsheet code, I've lept head-first into my new career, undertaking the highly selective Makers Academy software engineering accelerator program. I've been unleashed into the programming world and I'm excited to put on display the results of journey so far, and demonstrate my ever increasing tech stack through this portfolio of projects

### <a name="Experience">Work Experience</a>

#### Business Development Manager (Growth Team) | MVF Global (April 2019 – September 2021)

I am responsible for Researching, Selling, Launching and Account Managing new industry launches. I’ve recently originated and implemented a new business model, CPC, in an industry we had no prior experience in. I was promoted into a senior role as a Business Development Manager (Growth Team) 7 months after joining the company.

#### Support, Business Analyst and Business Development | Sabrefish (SaaS) (Sept 2017 – March 2019)

Learning a completely new SaaS platform from scratch, I began solving complex technical system faults using technical documentation and advanced SQL. I was quickly promoted from solving tech support issues to a client-facing Business Analyst and Business Development role. I was the direct point of contact for our Key Client, and also assisted our CEO with new business client pitches.

#### Assistant Procurement Manager | Laing O’Rourke (Sept 2015 – August 2017)

After graduating from Cardiff University I joined the Laing O’Rourke Graduate programme and was on track to become a Procurement Manager. It was here that I created a full P2P system in just excel/vba, with no prior coding knowledge. I created numerous tech guides for our CRM system, and lead training sessions teaching usiers how to speed up their workflow with tech shortcuts.
